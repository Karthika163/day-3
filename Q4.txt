Task1:
Q1:Declare four variables without assigning values and print them in console
Ans: var name; or: let Name; After the declaration, the variable has no value technically it is undefined.

Q2:How to get value of the variable myvar as output
ans: var a = myvar;
console.log(a)

Q4:Declare variables to store your first name, last name, marital status, country and age in single lines
var obj = {
    firstname: "abc",
    lastname: "D",
    maritalstatus: "Married" ,
    country: "india",
    age:25
  }
  console.log(obj)
  
  
  Q5:Declare variables and assign string, boolean, undefined and null data types
  let a= ["name:g","age:25", " undefind " ,"roll no: 0"  ]
 console.log(a[1]);


Q6:Convert the string to integer
using by parseInt() and also Plus sign(+)

Q7:Write 6 statement which provide truthy & falsey values.
var a = [1,2,4,5,8]
if(a%2===0)
{console.log(true);}
else

TASK 2: 
Q1:Square of a number

let a= 3
let b=2
let c = (2/(Math.sqrt(a*a)))
console.log(c);

 Q2:Swapping 2 numbers
 temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;
let a= 4
let b=3
 temp = a
 a=b;
 b=temp;
console.log(b);

Q3:Addition of 3 numbers
declare a variable a,b,c 
console.log(a+b+c)
const a= 4;
const b= 3;
const  c= 6
console.log(a+b+c);


Q4:Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion
°F = °C × (9/5) + 32 - formula
consider  an Celsius is 3
(3*(9/5)+(32))
let c =3;
d=((3*(9/5))+(32))
console.log(d);

Q5:Meter to miles
To multiply the number by 1609.34. For example, to convert 5 miles into meters,
 you need to multiply it with 1609.34
 let a=5;
 let b= (a*1609.34);
 console.log(b);


Q6:Pounds to kg
Multiply the given 5 pounts by 0.45359237 kg. Therefore, 5 pounts is approximately equal to 2.26796185 kg.
let x = 5
let c = (x*0.45359237)
console.log(c);

Q7:Calculate Batting Average
It is calculated by dividing the total number of runs scored by a batsman 
by the number of times they have been out
let run1 = 164
let run2= 54
let out = 2
let c = ((run1+run2)/out)
console.log(c);

Q9:Power of any number x ^ y.
Math.pow(x,y)
let x = 2
let y= 3
let c = Math.pow (2,3)
console.log(c);


Q10:Calculate Simple Interest
A = P (1 + rt)
A	=	final amount
P	=	initial principal balance
r	=	annual interest rate
t	=	time (in years)
let p = 4
let r= 3
let t=5
let c = (4*(1+(3*5)))
console.log(c);



18.Given two numbers and perform all arithmetic operations.
let a = 4
let b= 3
let c = ((a+b)-(a*b)/(a)%(b))
console.log(c);


19.Display the asterisk pattern as shown below(No loop needed):
let a = "*****"
console.log(a,a,a,a,a);



How would you represent the following data using a combination of object literals and arrays? (You can describe a strategy without typing or writing out the whole thing.)

function obj = {
  [Guvi, Geek, 6, IIT-M RP,Chennai.
Amazon, Inc, 31, SP Infocity, Chennai.
Google, Alphabet, 34 Amphitheater Parkway, MountainView.
Tesla, Inc , 32, 333 Santana Row,San Jose]
}.



myobject = {1:one,”11":1,”name”:”arun”}
//your code goes here
console.log(myobject);
{"1":"one","11":1,"name":"arun","ten":"ten"} // Quotes might not get displayed that fine.
o/p:
{1:one,”11":1,”name”:”arun”}
